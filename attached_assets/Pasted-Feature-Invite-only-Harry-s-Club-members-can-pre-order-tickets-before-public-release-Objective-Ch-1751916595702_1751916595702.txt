Feature: Invite-only Harry’s Club members can pre-order tickets before public release.
Objective: Charge users only after supply is confirmed, then send tickets upon successful payment.

🧑‍🎓 USER SIDE – Member Pre-Order Experience
A. Pre-Order Flow (Mon–Sun)
Logged-in members can pre-order 1 event ticket per week.

Pre-order form includes:

Event title

Ticket quantity (limit = 1)

Price preview (with member discount)

Card entry (Stripe SetupIntent)

Confirm CTA: “Pre-order – no charge now”

Backend logic:

Create Stripe Customer and store payment_method_id via SetupIntent

Save pre-order in database with:

user_id

event_id

status: pending

payment_method_id

Stripe customer ID

B. UI Feedback
After placing pre-order:

Show status: “Pre-order received. We’ll charge your card at 7PM Tuesday if your ticket is confirmed.”

Option to cancel or edit pre-order before Sunday 11:59PM

Display current week’s pre-order status in dashboard:

Pending

Successful – Ticket Sent

Failed – Card Declined

🧑‍💼 ADMIN SIDE – Pre-Order Management (Mon–Tue)
A. Admin Dashboard – Event Pre-Orders

💳 PAYMENT & TICKET DELIVERY LOGIC – Tuesday @ 7PM
A. Scheduled Fulfilment Script (Run @ 7PM Tues)
For each approved pre-order:

});
