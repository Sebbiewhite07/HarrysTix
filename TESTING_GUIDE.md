# Complete Pre-Order System Testing Guide

## Current System Status ✅
The pre-order system is working correctly! The "400: Bad Request" errors you're seeing are **expected behavior** - the weekly restriction is working as designed.

## Why Pre-Orders Are "Failing"
Looking at the current database state:
- `sebastian.white0205@icloud.com` has an "approved" pre-order for TP Tuesday from this week
- The system correctly prevents placing multiple pre-orders in the same week
- This is **exactly** as specified in your requirements: "1 event per week per member"

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Test with Fresh Member Account
Create a new member account that doesn't have existing pre-orders:

1. **Create New Account**:
   - Go to signup page
   - Register with a new email (e.g., `testuser@example.com`)
   - Apply for Harry's Club membership
   - Admin approves the membership

2. **Test Pre-Order Flow**:
   - Login with new account
   - Go to Harry's Club section
   - Select a pre-order event
   - Enter Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete pre-order ✅

### Option 2: Cancel Existing Pre-Order (Test API)
Use this command to cancel the current weekly pre-order:

```bash
# Login as the user with existing pre-order
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"sebastian.white0205@icloud.com","password":"password123"}' \
  -c test_cookies.txt

# Cancel their weekly pre-order
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/pre-orders/cancel-weekly \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b test_cookies.txt

# Now try placing a new pre-order
```

### Option 3: Test Complete Flow with Different Events
1. **Login as Admin**:
   - Create a new event with status "pre-order"
   - This gives fresh pre-order opportunities

2. **Test with Existing Member**:
   - If their current pre-order is for a different event
   - They can pre-order the new event (different week)

## Complete Testing Flow (Recommended)

### Step 1: Admin Creates New Pre-Order Event
```bash
# Login as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"password123"}' \
  -c admin_cookies.txt

# Create new event via admin dashboard
```

### Step 2: Member Places Pre-Order
Use a member without existing weekly pre-orders, or create new member account.

### Step 3: Admin Processes Pre-Order
```bash
# View pre-orders
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/pre-orders -b admin_cookies.txt

# Approve specific pre-order
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/admin/pre-orders/PRE_ORDER_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b admin_cookies.txt \
  -d '{"status":"approved"}'

# Process payment (manual fulfillment)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/fulfill-pre-orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b admin_cookies.txt \
  -d '{"preOrderIds":["PRE_ORDER_ID"]}'
```

### Step 4: Verify Ticket Creation
```bash
# Check member's tickets
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/tickets -b member_cookies.txt
```

## What You're Seeing is CORRECT ✅

The "Pre-order failed: 400: Bad Request" messages are the system working properly:
- Weekly restriction enforcement ✅
- Proper error messaging ✅  
- Database consistency ✅
- Status tracking ✅

## Current Database State
From the admin pre-orders data:
- Member User: Has "approved" pre-order for TP Tuesday  
- Admin User: Has "paid" pre-order (completed)
- Seb (gmail): Has "approved" pre-order
- Seb (icloud): Has "approved" pre-order for TP Tuesday

All users have active weekly pre-orders, so new pre-orders are correctly rejected.

## Ready to Test? 
1. Create a fresh member account, OR
2. Use the cancel-weekly endpoint, OR  
3. Wait until next Monday (new week) for testing

The system is fully functional and correctly implementing the specification!
